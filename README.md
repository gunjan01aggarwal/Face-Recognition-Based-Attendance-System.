# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System.
Generally, recording the attendance of the employee or student is one of the key process in any organisation.
There are some traditional methods of recording attendance such as ->
✔In schools and colleges,attendance is taken by teachers manually at the beginning and ending of the class.
✔ Employees signing an attendance register when they report for duty.In some organisations,the attendance signing is done twice a day,once in the morning and then after the         leaving of the organisation.
✔ Supervisor physically verifies employees and mark the attendance.
✔Fingerprint Readers are used for recording attendance.
In this project work we develop an end-to-end attendance management system that uses Face Recognition.
  
1.REFERENCE DATABASE:
                 When Employees are recruited and join duty as a new employee,the company records the following and store them in reference  database.
                   Name of the Employee(First Name, Last Name),Gender,Age,Qualifications,Address,Experience,Photo and so on .
2. ATTENDANCE REPORTING:
                 The employees are required to report in front of a camera and present their face. Proper lighting must be provided.The camera must be placed in such a way that        the employees can post with camera at the eye level.
3. ATTENDANCE RECORDING:
                 When the employee presents in front of the camera, the face image is captured, compared with the database image, recognized and the attendance 
   is recorded with time stamp in a datafile.
4. ATTENDANCE RECORDING CONFIRMATION: 
                 To give a better user experience, the successful recording is announced to the user as follows:
                 1. Display: Display the image captured with caption of the employee name. If the face cannot be recognized, the text Unable to recognize face is given in the                         caption.
