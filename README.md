# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System.
Generally, recording the attendance of the employee or student is one of the key process in any organisation.
There are some traditional methods of recording attendance such as ->
✔In schools and colleges,attendance is taken by teachers manually at the beginning and ending of the class.
✔ Employees signing an attendance register when they report for duty.In some organisations,the attendance signing is done twice a day,once in the morning and then after the         leaving of the organisation.
✔ Supervisor physically verifies employees and mark the attendance.
✔Fingerprint Readers are used for recording attendance.
 In this project work we develop an end-to-end attendance management system that uses Face Recognition.
