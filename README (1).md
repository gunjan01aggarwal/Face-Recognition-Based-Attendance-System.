FACE RECOGNITION BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM.

Generally, recording the attendance of the employee or student is one of the key process in any organisation. There are some traditional methods of recording attendance such as -> ✔In schools and colleges,attendance is taken by teachers manually at the beginning and ending of the class. ✔ Employees signing an attendance register when they report for duty.In some organisations,the attendance signing is done twice a day,once in the morning and then after the leaving of the organisation. ✔ Supervisor physically verifies employees and mark the attendance. ✔Fingerprint Readers are used for recording attendance. 

The problem:

 With the manually taking attendance is that it requires some time to take and also the manual process will have chances to make mistakes in most of the cases.

With the Fingerprint Readers is that:
    - Not suitable with wet hands.
    - Germs Transmit.
    - Can't use it if the person doesn't have fingers .
